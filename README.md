# animatable
One property, two values, endless possiblities

I hope to learn more and then make a ILY animatable! AN ILY is a ASL sign language sign. It looks like metal rock sign you would do with the two fingers up on the ends of the hand. The only difference is that the Thumb comes out and forms an "L" with the hand and the pinkie finger is still standing and the middle two fingers are folded. This is a long form explaiation. I might make it simple later. 

sp first I need to figure out what parts will move and how it will work I will do this work mostly on pen and paper as it's the most powerful editing program I know to man.
